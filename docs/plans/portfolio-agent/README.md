# Portfolio Agent Reliability Plan

This small index routes the sustained three-sweep goal. Each linked note keeps
one responsibility so later work can be discovered progressively without
reloading a monolithic plan. The historical record remains in
[[plans/portfolio-agent/implementation-sweeps/README|the implementation ledger]].

## Sequence

1. [[plans/portfolio-agent/audit|Audit and decision record]] — complete.
2. [[plans/portfolio-agent/sweeps/31-non-destructive-mcp-rediscovery|Sweep 31 — non-destructive catalog rediscovery]] — complete.
3. [[plans/portfolio-agent/sweeps/32-shared-mcp-discovery-deadline|Sweep 32 — shared MCP discovery deadline]] — complete.
4. [[plans/portfolio-agent/sweeps/33-structured-diagnostics|Sweep 33 — structured diagnostics]] — complete.
5. [[plans/portfolio-agent/sweeps/34-cross-record-evidence-grounding|Sweep 34 — cross-record evidence grounding]] — source implementation complete; deployment and live replay pending.
6. [[plans/portfolio-agent/sweeps/35-conversational-evidence-grounding|Sweep 35 — conversational evidence grounding]] — source implementation complete; deployment and live replay pending.
7. [[plans/portfolio-agent/sweeps/36-mobile-assistant-responsive-surface|Sweep 36 — mobile assistant responsive surface]] — implementation in progress; browser and real-device gates pending.

Reliability work is implemented incrementally in focused sweeps. Each sweep
has its own acceptance gate and records source/test evidence separately from
deployment or live behavior.

## Deferred

[[plans/portfolio-agent/deferred|Deferred reliability work]] contains the
remaining recommendations without mixing them into the active sweep notes.
