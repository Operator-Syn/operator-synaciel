# Sweep 21 — provider-authoritative capacity messaging

Back to [[plans/portfolio-agent/implementation-sweeps/README|the implementation sweep index]].

**Date:** 2026-08-31

**Scope:** false account-wide neuron estimate, provider-capacity errors, and
explicit UTC reset guidance.

- [x] Confirmed the reported false pause against live evidence: the auth D1
      control row held an 8,050-neuron local estimate while the Workers AI
      dashboard showed 554/10,000 neurons for the UTC day.
- [x] Removed the fixed per-turn estimate from the admission path. The control
      row now acts as an administrator pause switch and clears only its legacy
      `daily-neuron-budget` marker.
- [x] Added a narrow classifier for Workers AI's out-of-capacity signal
      (including provider error code `3040`) and the exact user-facing copy:
      "The model is at its maximum daily capacity. Please try again at 00:00
      UTC."
- [x] Kept the 22,000-token/30-minute per-user reservation separate from the
      provider's account-wide capacity and added regression coverage for both
      paths.

The source fix is not a provider quota reset and does not change Cloudflare's
actual usage. The stale production control row must be cleared by an
operator-authorized D1 control update or the next token request will clear its
legacy automatic marker; manual administrator pauses remain intact.
