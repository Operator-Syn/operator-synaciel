# Portfolio Agent Implementation Sweep Index

This directory keeps one focused note per historical implementation sweep for
the public portfolio assistant. The notes preserve source/build evidence,
approval-gated provisioning and deployment work, and representative live
checks without reloading a monolithic ledger.

Back to [[plans/portfolio-agent/README|the Portfolio Agent Reliability Plan]].

## How to use this index

Create the next numbered note when a bounded implementation change is recorded.
Keep its scope, date, changed contracts, exact checks, and evidence boundary in
that note. Source or build output must not be used to claim deployment or live
behavior.

## Current reliability follow-ons

The reliability program continues in the focused notes below. They are linked
from the historical sequence so the implementation record and current
reliability work remain navigable without copying their evidence.

- [[plans/portfolio-agent/sweeps/31-non-destructive-mcp-rediscovery|Sweep 31 — non-destructive catalog rediscovery]]
- [[plans/portfolio-agent/sweeps/32-shared-mcp-discovery-deadline|Sweep 32 — shared MCP discovery deadline]]
- [[plans/portfolio-agent/sweeps/33-structured-diagnostics|Sweep 33 — structured diagnostics]]
- [[plans/portfolio-agent/sweeps/34-cross-record-evidence-grounding|Sweep 34 — cross-record evidence grounding]]
